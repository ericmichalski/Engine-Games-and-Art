Unfinished Business is a networked group project on Unity which was coded in C# during January's Global Game Jam 2021.
Humans must stop the ghosts from collecting the sandwich, which is locked behind a door that requires multiple keys.
The ghosts can possess objects to hide from the humans, though the humans can slap the objects, which force the ghosts out.
Once the ghosts are out of an object, the humans can slap them again and turn them into humans.
If the humans stop all the ghosts, they win. But if the ghosts get the sandwich, they win.
