1) [Unfinished Business](https://github.com/ericmichalski/Engine-Games-and-Art/blob/master/Unity/Unfinished-Business.md) is an online multiplayer prop hunt style of game and was my first Unity project. (2021)
2) VR Training Project. This is unlisted as it was developed for Siemens Digital Industries Software. It involved hand tracking, curved UI's, voice commands, 3D manipulation (scaling, translating, rotating, detaching/attaching, etc.) of various real models using the voice commands and hand tracking, and such.

3) [We Remember](https://github.com/vanblakp/CS5001-Senior-Design/tree/development) is a singleplayer wave-based survival game based around the Alamo. The game can be played by downloading the zip file within the Builds folder and the main branch has a lot of back end details and documents related to what exactly each member of the group did.
