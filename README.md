# Projects
This repository is a list of projects I personally created or with a small group. Most of them are in C++, though a few are in Python. 
Some of them are older and I was not as experienced then, so there may be a more efficient way to code the program.
I currently am still working on more projects outside of class, but I have been busy working on learning Unreal Engine 4.
