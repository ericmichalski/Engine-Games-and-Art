# Projects
This repository is a list of games and art I personally created or with a small group.
The games listed are all built in various engines, including Unreal Engine and Unity.
So, unlike the other game repositories, each game here will provide a link to the itch.io webpage to download and play the game.
The itch pages also have images and videos of gameplay along with plenty of comments and videos from the public to read.
Additionally, each game here provides more details on the background side of things.
Of these, the largest and most extensive game I have worked on is [The Flight](https://github.com/ericmichalski/Projects/tree/master/Unreal%20Engine/TheFlight).
I currently am busy working on individual projects within Unreal Engine outside of class/work.
