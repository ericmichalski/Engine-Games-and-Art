# Crawlspace

Crawlspace is a short, first person horror game about exploring the small spaces underneath one's home after a child goes missing within them.

Similar to The Flight, I thought this was another interesting concept for a horror game.
I wanted to move away from the traditional, walk-around type of indie horror game and I also wanted to focus on a
 smaller space compared to The Flight, which was very open due to it being in an airport.
This was my first game built in Unreal Engine 5 and I learned quite a lot about AI and in-game interaction without a UI.

This game took about 87 hours to complete.
I was able to reuse some assets (such as the main menu and player code) from my previous two games which is why the time is less, however it is also a smaller game.
