The Flight is a short first person horror game about someone waking up on an empty flight.
They do not remember much before awakening and have to explore and investigate the seemingly abandoned airport.

It is the first horror game that I have constructed and I originally just released a demo, but later decided to make a larger experience with a full game given the positive feedback.
