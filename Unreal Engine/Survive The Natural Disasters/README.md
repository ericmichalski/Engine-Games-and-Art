# Survive The Natural Disasters

See how long you can survive against various natural disasters as they rain down upon you in extreme measures.
Keep everything natural looking, or change things up with several options to edit the disasters including the colors, speed, frequency, and much more.
The longer you live, the more points you can receive to buy various upgrades to improve your chances of survival.

I took inspiration from a Roblox game, yes a Roblox game, that was titled in a similar fashion.
It was an online multiplayer experience that made players compete to survive various natural disasters.
Although I did not incorporate a multiplayer aspect, that was not my goal in this.
I wanted to make a visually stunning and realistic version of the cartoony game which is why I chose Unreal Engine.
I also limited the amount of disasters (for release, but more could be added) as keeping it realistic is quite challenging.
So, I incorporated a lightning storm, fire that burnt the environment, and a volcano launching magma rocks.

This game took me around 158 hours to complete.
