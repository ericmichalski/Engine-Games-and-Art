Folder for the recreation of the map Mira from Among Us to Unreal Engine 4 and First Person

This project has been my most extensive one so far, as I had to construct the map by myself with limited assets.
However, I was able to find, use, and even create the assets necessary for the recreation.
I started with a basic layout, using UE4's BSP geometry.
Then I proceeded to make basic custom materials, most of which I made myself.
After that, I added more BSP geometry and continued applying materials.
Once I constructed the basic layout (floor, walls, ceiling) with simple materials, I worked on each individual room.
This took a majority of the time because there were a lot of rooms with various amounts of complexity and
I had to find and even create several assets to improve the look of the rooms.
Then, I used Unreal Engine's volumetric clouds to construct realistic looking clouds outside the windows of the map.
I added ambient sound with attentutation within the map and created sequences for the decontamination doors and sliding glass doors.
Finally, I made some last adjustments and tweaks, and added reflections captures along with some light post processing effects.
There are many improvements that I can make, though as I mentioned, it is very challenging by myself.
