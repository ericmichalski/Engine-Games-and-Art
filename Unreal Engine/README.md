This is a collection of projects and creations within Unreal Engine 4 that I developed.
One video demos the gameplay, weapons, AI, and even a frost trap from R6 Siege, in a controlled environment.
The second video will show the level in the game that I constructed along with structures and environments that I developed myself.
However, I have had an issue with it loading properly, so I cannot access it and may have to redo some elements, such as the foliage.
So, this video will not be up until I have time to fix it.
Regardless, I have learned a lot by myself within Unreal Engine and this folder supports that.
