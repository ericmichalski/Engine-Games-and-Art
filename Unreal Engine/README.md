# Unreal Engine

This is a collection of projects and creations within Unreal Engine 4 or 5. Most were developed by myself, although a few were with a group.
****Note:*** please reference my newest creations (or fully released games) for my best work.

### Individual
1) The Flight is a short horror game based around an empty airport and is the largest project I have worked on.
2) Scenes is a collection of stationary scenes.
3) AmongUs is a recreation of a map from the top down game Among Us to a first person, 3D version.
4) Various Assets is a short video of a group of smaller coding projects and game assets that were not used in any released game.
5) Demo_VideoLink is a video that will show the level in the very first unreleased game that I constructed along with structures and environments that I designed.

## Group
1) Transcience is my second game jam game that I constructed alongside five others, two of which were also programmers.
