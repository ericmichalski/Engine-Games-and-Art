This is a collection of projects and creations within Unreal Engine 4 that I developed.

1) Assets_Demo showcases the gameplay, weapons, AI, and a frost trap from R6 Siege, in a controlled environment.
2) Demo_Compressed will show the level in the game that I constructed along with structures and environments that I developed myself.
However, I had to compress it due to file restraints within github, so the quality of the video is quite poor compared to the
actual quality of the game.
3) WallDestruction_GrzmotMine showcases Ela's Grzmot mine from R6 Siege along with a little wall destruction that can occur if it is 
shot, hit with a frag grenade, or if the zombie AI tear it down. The Grzmot mine applies a stun and slow effect for about 6 seconds when a player moves within a certain radius of the mine.
4) EDD Mine demos Kapkan's tripwire mine. A laser is shown at first, but it fades away similar to the actual in-game mine.
These go on doorways and can be set off by either the player, which damages their armor and health, or the zombie AI I developed
5) Banshee_NoModel shows Melusi's Banshee gadget without a 3D model (currently a white cube) that will be imported from blender and updated when I have the time to model it.
The Banshee gadget slows down players when they are within a certain radius of the gadget. It cannot be shot, only destroyed by a melee hit or explosives.
6) GuMine_NoModel displays Lesion's Gu Mine without a 3D model (currently a dark sphere) that will be imported from blender and updated when I have the time to model it.
The Gu mine activates when a player steps on the gu. It will slow the player down and apply 5 damage every 3 seconds after the player steps on it as long as the player does not take the gu mine out. If the player presses a button (in this case "V"), then the action to take the gu mine out occurs, which takes 3 seconds. The player can stop pushing the button, but the gu mine will remain until the player holds it down for the 3 seconds.
7) Soon to be added in order: Jager's Active Defense System (ADS)

I am also by myself and I am not attempting to construct a complete game, but rather show what I have learned and now know.
Regardless, I have learned a lot by myself within Unreal Engine and this folder supports that.
