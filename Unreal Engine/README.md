This is a collection of projects and creations within Unreal Engine 4 that I developed.

1) Assets_Demo showcases the gameplay, weapons, AI, and a frost trap from R6 Siege, in a controlled environment.
2) Demo_Compressed will show the level in the game that I constructed along with structures and environments that I developed myself.
However, I had to compress it due to file restraints within github, so the quality of the video is quite poor compared to the
actual quality of the game.
3) WallDestruction_GrzmotMine showcases Ela's Grzmot mine from R6 Siege along with a little wall destruction that can occur if it is 
shot, hit with a frag grenade, or if the zombie AI tear it down.
4) EDD Mine demos Kapkan's tripwire mine. A laser is shown at first, but it fades away similar to the actual in-game mine.
These go on doorways and can be set off by either the player, which damages their armor and health, or the zombie AI I developed

I am also by myself and I am not attempting to construct a complete game, but rather show what I have learned and now know.
Regardless, I have learned a lot by myself within Unreal Engine and this folder supports that.
