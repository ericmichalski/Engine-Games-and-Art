This is a collection of projects and creations within Unreal Engine 4. Most were developed by myself, although a few were with a group.

1) AmongUs is the largest and most extensive project I have worked on by myself.
2) Scenes is a collection of stationary scenes that I designed.
3) The Flight is a short horror game that I developed by myself.
4) Transcience is my second game jam game that I constructed alongside five others, two of which were also programmers.
5) Various Assets is a short video of a group of smaller coding projects which I made.
6) Demo_VideoLink is a video that will show the level in the first game that I constructed in Unreal Engine along with structures and environments that I designed.
