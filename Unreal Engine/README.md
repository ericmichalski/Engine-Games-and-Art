This is a collection of projects and creations within Unreal Engine 4 that I developed.
One video demos the gameplay, weapons, AI, and even a frost trap from R6 Siege, in a controlled environment.
The second video will show the level in the game that I constructed along with structures and environments that I developed myself.
However, I had to compress it due to file restraints within github, so the quality of the video is quite poor compared to the
actual quality of the game.
I am by myself and I am not attempting to construct a complete game, but rather show what I have learned and now know.
Regardless, I have learned a lot by myself within Unreal Engine and this folder supports that.
