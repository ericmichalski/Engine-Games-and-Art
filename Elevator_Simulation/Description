//  This code is a simulation of one to three elevators during the course of one day
//    with randomized amounts of people arriving on each floor.

//  The code begins with allowing people to arrive on any floor
//    and includes three elevators.
//  To alter this, simply comment out the
//    lines of code mentioned near the beginning of Source.cpp
//  To change the number of elevators, comment out the move
//    functions which should be called in lines 83, 84, 90, and 91.

//  People are generated each time the elevator moves a floor, but the chances
//  of people "spawning" are low enough to not flood the simulation.

Assumptions
***********

1. If the elevator is going up, it only picks people up along the way if they are in up queue
2. If the elevator is going down, it only picks people down along the way if they are in down queue
3. If elevator is idle, add 10 seconds to its run time since it is not picking anyone up
4. If up and down queues are empty, the target floor for the elevator should be the fist floor on the waitingFloors list. If moving, the target floor 
should be the floor of the first person in the queue, where queue is determined by the direction the elevator is moving
5. The time for the elevator to move 1 floor is 10 seconds
6. Time for people to board and exit the elevator is negligable
7. Assume the building is 6 floors tall
8. Assume elevator starts on floor 1
9. Assume elevator can hold at max 10 people
10. Weight of people on elevator does not matter
11. Number of people waiting on a floor can not exceed 6
